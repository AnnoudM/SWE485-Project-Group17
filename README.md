Project Motivation:

Choosing the right high school is a critical decision for students and parents, as it directly impacts educational experiences and future opportunities. With numerous high schools available, selecting the most suitable one can be challenging without a structured way to compare options. We chose to work on this dataset because it provides comprehensive information about high schools in Saudi Arabia. Our goal is to analyze this data to develop a recommendation system for high schools based on user preferences. This system will help parents, students, and policymakers make informed decisions by identifying suitable high schools that align with their specific needs.
