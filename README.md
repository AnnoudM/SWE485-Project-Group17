Project Motivation:

Choosing the right school is a critical decision for students and parents, as it directly impacts educational experiences and future opportunities. With numerous schools available, selecting the most suitable one can be challenging without a structured way to compare options. We chose to work on this dataset because it provides comprehensive information about schools in Saudi Arabia. Our goal is to analyze this data to develop a recommendation system for schools based on user preferences. This system will help parents and students make informed decisions by identifying suitable schools that align with their specific needs.
